This code is used to plot
* The number of cases and death and their daily variation as a function of time for France, the US, Italy and Gemrnay as well as for the world
* The stack plot of the number of cases and death

As for all the codes in the respiratory, if the `import_df_from_I()` function is used instead of `import_df_from_xlsx()`, the data is automaticaly updated.
For this code, the data is imported from [John Hopkins Univeristy](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series).

Examples of the output:
