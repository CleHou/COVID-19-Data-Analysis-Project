# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project - 03 - Predictions
This code is used to generate the prediction of the number of cases base on a logistic regression model.

As for all the codes in the repository, if the `import_df_from_I()` function is used instead of `import_df_from_xlsx()`, the data is automaticaly updated.
For this code, the data is imported from [John Hopkins Univeristy](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series), [Sant√© Publique France](https://www.census.gov/topics/population.html).
