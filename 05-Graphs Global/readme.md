# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project - 02 - Maps
This code is used to generate graphs (number of cases and death and their daily evolution) of a certain subpart of a chosen scale (e.g. on a world scale a subpart would be a country, on a national scale, a subpart would be a region or a states). The output is a PDF where each page is the graph of a subpart.

As for all the codes in the repository, if the `import_df_from_I()` function is used instead of `import_df_from_xlsx()`, the data is automaticaly updated.
For this code, the data is imported from [John Hopkins Univeristy](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series), [OpenCOVID19 France GitHub repository](https://github.com/opencovid19-fr/data/blob/master/dist/chiffres-cles.csv), [Sant√© Publique France](https://www.census.gov/topics/population.html).
